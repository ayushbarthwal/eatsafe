The Food Quality Management System is a database-driven project designed to ensure effective tracking, evaluation, and maintenance of food quality across suppliers and production batches. The primary objective of this system is to automate and streamline the storage, retrieval, and analysis of food inspection data, reducing human errors and improving traceability in food safety operations.
The system consists of five core entities — FoodItem, Supplier, Inspector, Batch, and QualityTest — that collectively capture detailed information about food products, their sources, test parameters, and inspection outcomes. Using advanced SQL concepts such as stored procedures, functions, transactions, indexing, and views, the system provides an efficient platform for performing data integrity checks, generating reports, and ensuring compliance with quality standards.
Key features include:
• Automated test recording and validation through stored procedures.
• Performance optimization using indexes for faster query execution.
• Backup and reporting mechanisms through SQL views.
• Transaction management with rollback and commit operations ensuring data consistency.
• Aggregated analytics such as category-wise quality summaries.
The project demonstrates the real-world application of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts using Oracle SQL and PL/SQL, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation. It ensures data security, supports decision-making, and enhances transparency in the food supply chain. Ultimately, this project contributes to building a reliable digital framework for maintaining food quality standards and supporting regulatory audits.
